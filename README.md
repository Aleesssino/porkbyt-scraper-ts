This TypeScript-based bot is my answer to the housing crisis in Brno, crafted specifically to help me and my fellow Slovak friends find an apartment in this chaotic rental market. If you’re also caught in the seemingly endless hunt for a flat, this bot might just save your sanity.

## Features

- **Automated Web Scraping**: Utilizes Puppeteer to scrape the Bezrealitky website for the latest rental listings.
- **30-Minute Checks**: The bot runs approximately every 30 minutes, ensuring you don’t miss any new listings in this competitive market.
- **Telegram Notifications**: Sends a message with a link to the new apartment offer directly to our Telegram chat.

## Why This Exists

The housing market in Brno is like trying to find a needle in a haystack, but the haystack is on fire and the needle is invisible. We built this bot out of sheer desperation and a bit of tech wizardry.

## Behind the Scenes

Working with Puppeteer was a rollercoaster. It was fun, exhilarating, and occasionally left me stuck on the dumbest errors imaginable.

## Disclaimer

To run this bot, you'll need to be signed into Bezrealitky, which costs around 600 CZK. It's not exactly a low-barrier project, but if you're in the same apartment-hunting boat, it's a small price for a little peace of mind.

**Note:** This README is more of a blog post about my personal journey with apartment hunting and Puppeteer than formal documentation. If this bot actually helps us find our future apartment, or if I find myself extremely bored, I might put together a proper guide. Until then, consider this your peek behind the curtain of my rental woes!
